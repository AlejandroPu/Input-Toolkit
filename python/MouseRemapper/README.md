### MouseRemapper (Python)

Prototype that maps the **scroll wheel** to X/Y cursor movement.
It was designed as a quick add-on for my **Startup School** project but
was **not included in the final deliverable**.  
This Python version introduced noticeable lag, which led me to test a
lower-level C++ implementation instead.

#### Quick start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python mouse_remapper.py
```

#### Authorship
This prototype was generated in iterative pair-programming sessions with
ChatGPT; I added minor clean-ups and comments afterwards.
