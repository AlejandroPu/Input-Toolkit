### ControlMouse (C++ / Win32)

Low-level mouse-remapping prototype written in C++ after the Python
version caused noticeable lag on my laptop.  
It was meant to complement my **Startup School** project but was **not
included in the final deliverable**.

#### Build & Run
* Open `ControlMouse.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 and press **F5**.

#### Authorship
This prototype was generated in iterative pair-programming sessions with ChatGPT;
it is my first C++ code since around 1998.
