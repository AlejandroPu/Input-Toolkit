# Input-Toolkit

Small proof-of-concepts I built while developing my graduation project
through my university’s **Startup School** path.

| Folder | Prototype | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `python/MouseRemapper` | Scroll-wheel → cursor movement (Python) | Quick latency test; later replaced by a C++ version |
| `cpp/ControlMouse`    | Low-level mouse remap (C++/Win32) | Faster alternative to the Python script |
| `docs/`               | `RPi_WiFiDirect_raw.txt` + notes | Logbook of Wi-Fi Direct commands and FFmpeg streaming trials between two Raspberry Pi boards |

Part of the code was created in iterative pair-programming sessions with **ChatGPT**;  
I kept the raw notes and prototypes as historical reference.
